As a new developer of Ruter's advanced client technologies team, you have been given responsibility of their
commandline bus trip client! It is used to query the first 10 upcoming transports from a searchable area in Oslo.
The previous developer on this team has unfortunately resigned, and you are to take over.
The last thing he did was to rewrite the code from a synchronous to a parallel architecture, as there was many
complaints that the client was slow in getting all the bus trips.

Your assignment for the first hour of the day is;

- Bugs have been filed on the client not supporting input of place names with non-alphanumeric characters
  (St. Hanshaugen). Fix this.

- After the first search, the cursor is not positioned correctly. Can you fix this?

- Review the current code. What works, and where is there technical debt? Find 3 issues you would like to change.

- Still there are complaints, that in situations where network is slow, the output of the bus lines are messy.
  What can be the explanations of these? Plan (but don't code) what needs to be changed to be more robust against
  slow networks.
